          You should all keep learning about programming. The more
          you do it, the easier it will be. There are thousands of
          great resources for learning. Here are some of them.          
        </p>

        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is a tool for teaching programming within the visual arts
          community and visual literacy within the technology community. It is
          a great way to quickly make neat visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It comes in several flavors. Java is the default. There's a <a href="http://py.processing.org/">Python</a>
          flavor available as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Euler</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> offers hundreds
          of mostly math problems that are (usually) best solved with a computer.
          (Bonus points for finding the solutions with paper and pencil, which
          is definitely possible with many of them and preferable for a few.)
          You can use any programming language you want. Python is a pretty good
          choice.
        </p>

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
          You get to use this next year for FTC. Might as well learn it.
          Processing is a good place to start. There's a web site called
          <a href="https://learnjavathehardway.org/">Learn
            Java The Hard Way</a> has the first few chapters of a book with
          the same name. It provides some good pointers.
        </p>

        <h2>Android Studio</h2>
        <p>
          If you have an Android phone, you can start wirting software for it now.
          <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">Android Studio</a>
          is the development environment for FTC next year. It uses Java. It's free.
          You can download it and start playing around if you'd like.
